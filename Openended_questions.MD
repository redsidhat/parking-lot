As a new SRE for the team that manages a payment service for an internet company, how would you establish the SLA for your services?
Services:
- payment-request: Handles requests for orchestrating a payment using credit card
- payment-history: Management payment requests history
- payment-gateway: Initiates a payment request with PSP ( payment service provider for e.g Adyen )

As a new SRE responsible for the payment services of an internet company, I would take a structured approach to establish the SLA for our services. Firstly, we would identify the relevant performance matricss for our payment services, such as transaction success rate, response time, error rate, and reliability. Secondly, we would set acceptable levels for each performance matrics, taking into account our team's capacity and the industry standards. Based on these acceptable levels, we would establish achievable targets for our SLA. It is crucial to define the consequences of not meeting these targets to ensure we maintain our high-quality service. We would then communicate the SLA to our stakeholders, including customers and the management team, and regularly report on our performance. Lastly, we would continuously improve our services to exceed the agreed-upon SLA targets. It is worth noting that payment-request and payment-gateway services are more critical than payment history, so we would set lower thresholds for their SLAs to ensure they are faster and more reliable.

Key matrices for each services:
payment-request: Being a very critical process SRE matrices for SLA for payment-request should be the following
* Transaction success rate
* Response time
* Error rate
* Reliability

payment-history: Even though the criticality is less here the amount of data we deal with could be huge. The following matrices should have SLAs
* Availability
* Data integrity
* Data retention
* Searchability

payment-gateway: This is another critical component to set SLA. A few key matrices are as follows
* Security
* Availability
* Success rate
* Response time

Thresholds for these key matrices should be defined based ont he bussiness and services offered.
